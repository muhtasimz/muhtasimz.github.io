   <h2> Bio </h2>
   <p> Hello, my name is Muhtasim Maruf. I currently attend the University at Buffalo, and I am a Computer Science major. Although, I am completely new to programming, I am willing to learn and I hope to become a software developer in the future. Being born in Queens, I came from New York City, and therefore moving to Buffalo is a completely different experience for me. I love all things videogames, so if you see this and love videogames, contact me.
